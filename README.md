    <h2>My How it all Started </h2>
      <p>My name is Varalyn. I am from Ghana, West Africa but currently reside in North Carolina in the United States. I love to cook. eat, go out and have some fun from time to time</p>
      <p> I started off as a nurse because of my love for people but then covid happened and that made me change my mind. I decided to pursue something that would nurture my creativity side and i believe I made the right choice of deciding to be a software engineer. I love it so far!</p>
